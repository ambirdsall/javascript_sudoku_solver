JavaScript Sudoku Solver
========================
A program that solves sudoku puzzles, written entirely in javascript. It can 
handle both simple and difficult (i.e. that require guessing or have multiple 
solutions) sudoku puzzles, though there is currently no method to determine if 
a given puzzle is unsolvable. Just an infinite loop.
